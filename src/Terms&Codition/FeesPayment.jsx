              their financial information. Reliance disclaims all liabilities
              that may arise as a consequence of any unauthorised use of the
              user’s financial information and/or identity, including, details

              exceed such transaction limits imposed by Reliance, Reliance
              reserves the right to refuse to process such transactions.
              Reliance may refuse to process transactions emanating from users
              who have suspicious or questionable transaction history on the
              website. Should Reliance be dissatisfied with the credibility of a
              user or the genuineness of a transaction carried out on Tannis,
              Reliance shall have the right to reject such transactions.
              Reliance may also choose to delay the dispatch of products
              purchased by such users or cancel the entire purchase at its sole
              discretion. The user agrees that Reliance shall not be liable for
              any damage, interests or claims resulting from Reliance’s decision
              to not process a transaction or delay in the processing of a
              transaction on account of a user’s suspicious activity on the
              website.

              3.7. While thorough processes of verification are carried out
              prior to the publication of product prices on the website, errors
              and discrepancies arising out of technical glitches and time lags
              is unavoidable, despite our best efforts, in a certain case, there
              may be mispricing of products on the website during or after the
              process of purchase of products has been carried out by the user.
              For the avoidance of doubt, Reliance’s curative actions that will
              arise in the event of a price difference arising on the actual
              maximum retail price of products against the price published on
              Tannis are set out below:

              a) If the maximum retail price of the products delivered to the
              user is lower than the price published on the website, the user
              shall, within 24 (twenty four) hours from the time when he/she
              received the products, intimate to our customer support team. Upon
              Reliance being satisfied with the user’s claim, the difference in
              the purchase price against the maximum retail price shall be
              refunded to the user’s bank account within 1 (one) business day
              from the date of receiving the written notice from the user.;

              b) If the mode of payment for the order was ‘cash on delivery’ the

              the pop-up form that appears on the website/app while raising the
              return request. Upon receiving the user’s bank account details the
              refund will be credited to the user bank account. If the mode of
              payment for the order was through a payment option other than the
              ‘cash-on-delivery’ option, we may transfer the refund to the user
              source account that was used to make the initial payment.

              facilitate the payments between users and other third parties,
              apart from Reliance. These third parties may include other service
              providers including payment aggregators, prepaid instrument
              providers, courier and logistic service providers, etc. Upon
              successful delivery of the products purchased by you through
